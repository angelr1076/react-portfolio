              Growing up, I was always curious about how and why things worked
              the way that they did. As a youth, I would take many of my toys or
              devices apart and, sometimes, manage to put them back together.
              This helped me to become a much better problem-solver when it came
              to approaching problems and breaking things down into smaller
              pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              In mid-2018, after learning HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript,
              I decided to take a deeper dive into web development by enrolling
              in a web intensive boot-camp. This turned out to be the best
              investment in myself that I have ever made.
            </p>

            <p>
              My passion has always been to create new products that are useful
              to others; programming, in all of its facets, allows me to
              accomplish this by solving peopleâ€™s day-to-day problems and by also making
              their jobs less complicated.
