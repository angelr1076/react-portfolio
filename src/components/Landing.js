              Growing up, I was always curious about how and why things worked
              the way that they did. My parents would laugh at how I would take
              all of my toys or devices apart and, sometimes, manage to put them
              back together. In doing this, I didn't always figure it out, but
              it helped me become a better problem-solver when it came to
              approaching problems and breaking things down into smaller pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              In mid-2018, after teaching myself HTML, CSS and some JavaScript,
              I decided to take a deeper dive into development by enrolling in a
              web intensive boot-camp. This turned out to be the best investment
              in myself that I have ever made.
            </p>

            <p>
              My passion has always been to create new products that are useful
              to others; programming, in all of its facets, is one of the best
              ways for me to accomplish this by solving peopleâ€™s day-to-day
              problems and making their jobs a bit simpler.
            </p>

              It has been said that you should have hobbies outside of work. I
              do agree with that, but I also agree that if you enjoy work
              enough, it's almost a hobby in itself. I love to cook, spend time
              with my family and my pets, and I also love to learn in my spare
              time. I'm currently taking Harvard's CS50 course, learning C and
              sharpening my JavaScript skills by writing more algorithms in JS.
